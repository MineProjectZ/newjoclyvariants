# newjoclyvariants
This Repository is to create new Chess Variants for Jocly together. We want to bring many Chess Variants to Jocly.



every Variant gets his own Folder.
The Folder structure should look like this:
[variant name]
├──[variant name]-model.js
├──[variant name]-view.js
├──[variant name]-description.html
├──[variant name]-credits.html
├──[variant name]-rules.html
├──[variant name]-thumb.png
└──index.js
